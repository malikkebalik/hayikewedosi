She was born to Tricia in 1980 from a previous relationship and Keith adopted her and raised her as his own once he became romantically involved with Tricia years later. Although Shelley has kept her life as private as possible over the years, she did make a rare public appearance with her parents at a a SwingDish launch event in Las Vegas, NV in 2015. She went on to get married and have two children, making Toby a grandfather, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Country Fancast</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9><strong>Krystal Keith</strong> is Toby and Tricia’s second oldest <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>daughter</a>. She was born in 1985, the year after her parents got married. Like her dad, whose real last name is Covel, she decided to go with the stage last name of Keith, when in the public eye. Unlike her older sister, she’s been in the spotlight with her singing talents. She first got major attention for her singing when she sang “Mockingbird,” which was on her dad’s Greatest Hits 2 album in 2004. She also joined him on stage at the 2004 <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>CMAs</a> to sing the epic tune.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Krystal graduated from the University of Oklahoma and then signed a record deal with Show Dog-Universal Music. She went on to release various EPs and the 2013 album&nbsp;<i>Whiskey & Lace</i>. She wrote one of her most popular songs, “Daddy Dance with Me,” about Toby and performed it on her wedding day when she married <b>Andrew Robert Sandubrae</b> in 2010. After saying “I do,” she and Andrew welcomed two daughters, including<strong> Hensley Jack Sandubrae</strong>, who was born in 2015, and <strong>Kirby Kaye Sandubrae</strong>, who was born in 2019. She often shares memorable moments with her family, in photos and videos on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13><strong>Stelen Keith Covel</strong> is Toby and Tricia’s only son. He was born in 1997 and is an investor who works in venture management, according to his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>. In addition to a having a successful career, he has a loving marriage. He married his girlfriend <strong>Haley</strong>, in Boulder City in 2021 and he often <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>shares photos</a> with her on social media. One of his first posts included a photo of him as a kid with Toby, which can be seen above. “Tell me where I get it from.
