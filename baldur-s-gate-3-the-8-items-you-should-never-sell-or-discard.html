Some of it has a clear use, like awesome armor and weapons, but other things might not be so clear, which is why a lot of it is sold to sellers. But if you do that, you might lose some really fun and sometimes very important things that no amount of gold can buy back.</p><p>Baldur’s Gate 3 has so many items, like potions, spell scrolls, and valuable gems, that it would be hard to name them all. But not everything you find has a clear use, and sometimes you have to think outside the box to make the most of it.</p><p>Other things might be picked up a long time before the quest that needs them. If the loot in question has already been sold, some questlines will stop moving forward. With this in mind, there are a lot of apparently harmless things in Baldur’s Gate 3 that you should hold on to.</p><h2>8. Githyanki Egg</h2><p>A picture from Baldur’s Gate 3 shows the githyanki egg. It’s a big, bright green egg about the size and shape of a large coconut, with brown stalks growing out of it. It is sitting in a pool of green liquid that is boiling.</p><p>As part of the quest “Steal a Githyanki Egg,” you need to find the egg in Crèche Yllek. In Baldur’s Gate 3, there are a few things you can do with the githyanki egg. If you sell it by chance, you could ruin the whole quest.</p><p>Even though the quest has few good outcomes, cutting off any end because of a mistaken click is more than frustrating, and people who want to finish the quest should put the egg somewhere safe.</p><h2>7. Salami</h2><p>The party can find food and drink that can be used as camp goods all over Baldur’s Gate 3. When a character takes a long break, these are used to fully restore their skills. They are an important part of the game. One piece of food, however, can also be used as a weapon.</p><p><img alt="baldur's gate 3 items to keep" width=640 height=360 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theshahab.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/1-130.jpg></p><p>Funny enough, salami can also be used as a club that does 1d4 bludgeoning damage and can be used with two hands. So, salami can be used as camp goods and eaten, but many people find it much more fun to use the giant sausages to beat up their enemies.</p><h2>6. Toolkits for thieves and trap disarming</h2><p>It might not seem necessary to take thieves’ tools and trap-disarming toolkits unless you’re a rogue, but since everyone in the group shares an inventory, it’s a good idea for everyone to pick them up. Thieves tools and trap toolkits will be lost if you fail, so having more of these Baldur’s Gate 3 things is always a good idea.</p><p>They can be bought from some sellers, but they are also found in enough places around the world that the party should be able to pick any lock by taking all of the ones they find.</p><h2>5. Poison from Wyvern</h2><p>When the party meets Nettie in Druid Grove in Act One, she gives them one of the most powerful drugs in the game. The doctor gives them some wyvern poison and tells them to use it if they start to turn into mind flayers. Since that won’t happen, the party can keep this awesome poison and use it for themselves.</p><p>The best thing to do with any poison is to give it to Asterion or any other rogue. This is especially true if the best rogue type is Thief, as it gives an extra action. The poison can be added to a weapon through the drop bonus action, or it can be thrown at enemies to hit more than one of them.</p><h2>4. Bottles and jugs of water</h2><p>You can find jugs and bottles of water all over Baldur’s Gate 3, just like you can find camping gear. They can’t be added to the camp goods, but they can be drunk. The party should keep some of them in their inventory, though, because they can be useful in less obvious ways.</p><p>You can throw water bottles and jugs to put out fires or wash away acid or toxic pools that could hurt people. But one of the most fun things to do with them is to throw them at an enemy to make them wet.</p><p><img alt="baldur's gate 3 items to keep" width=640 height=360 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theshahab.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2-137.jpg></p><p>This enemy is now weak to damage from cold and lightning, which is a great way to get around enemies who are immune to those types of damage.</p><h2>3. Dark Amethyst</h2><p>The dark amethyst could be found by chance or as part of a quest related to The Necromancy of Thay, a strange Baldur’s Gate 3 book. The dark amethyst is in the well in the Blighted Village. It is guarded by phase spiders and their mother.</p><p>You need it to open the dark tome and find out what it says. However, there have been reports of people not paying attention to the details of the quest or hitting the wrong thing when they were at a vendor, which led to the amethyst being sold.</p><p>Since the amethyst is a key part of the quest, it’s best to put it somewhere safe until you can find the book again and bring it together.</p><h2>2. Infernal Iron</h2><p>Dammon, a tiefling, is standing in front of a wall of rocks. He looks to his right and seems to be paying close attention to someone.</p><p>Karlach tells the party as soon as they meet her that her hellish engine is acting up and she needs a repair. Dammon is the handyman in question. You can find him in Druid Grove and later in the Last Light Inn.</p><p>For him to help her, he will need infernal iron. He can find five pieces of infernal iron in Acts 1 and 2 of Baldur’s Gate 3. Dammon can do two fixes for Karlach and then use the rest to make the awesome Flawed Helldusk Armour set, so it’s a good idea to find all five pieces.</p><h2>1. Soul Coins</h2><p>Lastly, strange coins can be found all over Faerûn. At first glance, they don’t seem to have any use other than to sell for a good price. Soul coins are dark, heavy coins made from people’s souls and used as money in the Nine Hells.</p><p>Even though that sounds pretty nasty, soul coins in Baldur’s Gate 3 have a unique use that isn’t clear until Karlach joins the party and steals one. When she is angry, she can use the coins to give herself a little extra help in battle, so it’s a good idea to get them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJrAqa3Hmplnm5%2BifKO4zqBma2hiaHxxhI5ra2hwXZeurbDUq6pmn5Gpsm5%2FjKKrnqWjYsGwecqenKln</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbaldur-s-gate-3-the-8-items-you-should-never-sell-or-discard.html&text=Baldurs%20Gate%203%3a%20The%208%20Items%20You%20Should%20Never%20Sell%20or%20Discard&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbaldur-s-gate-3-the-8-items-you-should-never-sell-or-discard.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbaldur-s-gate-3-the-8-items-you-should-never-sell-or-discard.html&title=Baldurs%20Gate%203%3a%20The%208%20Items%20You%20Should%20Never%20Sell%20or%20Discard" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbaldur-s-gate-3-the-8-items-you-should-never-sell-or-discard.html&title=Baldurs%20Gate%203%3a%20The%208%20Items%20You%20Should%20Never%20Sell%20or%20Discard" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbaldur-s-gate-3-the-8-items-you-should-never-sell-or-discard.html&title=Baldurs%20Gate%203%3a%20The%208%20Items%20You%20Should%20Never%20Sell%20or%20Discard" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbaldur-s-gate-3-the-8-items-you-should-never-sell-or-discard.html&description=Baldurs%20Gate%203%3a%20The%208%20Items%20You%20Should%20Never%20Sell%20or%20Discard" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./dara-kravitz-gilbert-gottfried-s-spouse-bio-wiki-age-instagram-and-more-the-talks-today.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dara Kravitz (Gilbert Gottfrieds spouse) Bio, Wiki, Age, Instagram, and, More The Talks Today">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./sam-chapman-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sam Chapman Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
