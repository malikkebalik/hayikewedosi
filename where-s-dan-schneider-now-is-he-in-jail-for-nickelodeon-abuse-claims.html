Former&nbsp;All That cast members&nbsp;Giovonnie Samuels,&nbsp;Kyle Sullivan,&nbsp;Bryan Hearne,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Katrina Johnson&nbsp;and director&nbsp;Virgil Fabian&nbsp;<a href=#>pull back the curtain on the culture on set</a> of the beloved teen sketch series.&nbsp;</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>Writers&nbsp;Jenny Kilgen&nbsp;and&nbsp;Christy Stratton&nbsp;exposed allegations of a toxic and sexist environment in&nbsp;The Amanda Show&nbsp;writer’s room.&nbsp;Alexa Nikolas<strong>&nbsp;</strong>offers insight into being a part of&nbsp;Zoey 101.&nbsp;The four-part series also featured additional cast and crew from&nbsp;iCarly,&nbsp;Sam & Cat,&nbsp;Victorious,&nbsp;and other iconic series such as&nbsp;Marc Summer<strong>s</strong>&nbsp;from the popular game show&nbsp;Double Dare.&nbsp;The emotional testimony from parents of cast members who attempted to advocate for their children on these sets also features heavily. With all that said, here’s <a href=#>where Dan Schneider is now</a> after the allegations made by Quiet On Set.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=where-s-dan-schneider-now>Where’s Dan Schneider now?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/dan-schneider-nickelodeon.jpg><p><a href=#>Where’s Dan Schneider now</a>? He parted ways with Nickelodeon in 2018 after numerous complaints were made by staff claiming abusive behavior but he’s never been formally charged with anything. He was listed as a co-creator for the 2020 show&nbsp;Danger Force, which served as a spinoff for&nbsp;Henry Danger.&nbsp;</p><p>When the trailer for the series dropped, Schneider&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">released this statement</a>, per Deadline: “Dan cared about the kids on his shows even when sometimes their own families unfortunately did not. He understood what they were going through and he was their biggest champion.</p><p>“The fact is many of the kids on these shows are put in the untenable position of becoming the breadwinner for their family and the pressure that comes along with that. Add on top of that the difficulties of growing up and having to do so under the spotlight while working a demanding job, all as a child. That is why there are many levels of standards, executives, lawyers, teachers and parents everywhere, all the time, on every set, every day. However, it is still a hard place to be a kid and nobody knew that better than Dan.”</p><p>Since the first half of the series aired, another response was issued to refute the claims made by the iD documentary series. A rep for Schneider told Variety:</p><p>“Everything that happened on the shows Dan ran <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">was carefully scrutinized by dozens of involved adults</a>, and approved by the network. If there was an actual problem with the scenes that some people, now years later are ‘sexualizing,’ they would be taken down, but they are not, they are aired constantly all over the world today still, enjoyed by both kids and parents,” their statement said.</p><p>“Remember, all stories, dialogue, costumes, and makeup were fully approved by network executives on two coasts. A standards and practices group read and ultimately approved every script, and programming executives reviewed and approved all episodes. In addition, every day on every set, there were always parents and caregivers and their friends watching filming and rehearsals. Had there been any scenes or outfits that were inappropriate in any way, they would have been flagged and blocked by this multilayered scrutiny. Unfortunately, some adults project their adult minds onto kids’ shows, drawing false conclusions about them.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/quiet-on-set-the-dark-side-of-kids-tv.jpeg><p>In addition to claims of sexism, racism and inappropriate workplace behavior, the special also featured crew members alleging they were asked continuously to massage Schneider on set. “Dan deeply regrets asking anyone for neck massages,” his team told Variety in response. “Though they happened in public settings, he knows this was highly inappropriate and would never happen again.”</p><p>According to the series’ director Emma Schwartz, Nickelodeon was approached to participate but they declined. “Though we cannot corroborate or negate allegations of behaviors from productions decades ago, Nickelodeon as a matter of policy investigates all formal complaints as part of our commitment to fostering a safe and professional workplace environment free of harassment or other kinds of inappropriate conduct,” a spokesperson for the network told&nbsp;Variety.</p><p>“Our highest priorities are the well-being and best interests not just of our employees, casts and crew, but of all children, and we have adopted numerous safeguards over the years to help ensure we are living up to our own high standards and the expectations of our audience.”</p><p><strong>Quiet On Set: The Dark Side of Kids TV</strong> <strong>airs on Investigation Discovery and is available to stream on MAX</strong> <strong>at 9pm ET.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2ispmK6sMLInqpoaWdpfXKEkmibmqZdqLCpusSim56qXaO8uHs%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhere-s-dan-schneider-now-is-he-in-jail-for-nickelodeon-abuse-claims.html&text=Wheres%20Dan%20Schneider%20Now%3f%20Is%20He%20in%20Jail%20For%20Nickelodeon%20Abuse%20Claims%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhere-s-dan-schneider-now-is-he-in-jail-for-nickelodeon-abuse-claims.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhere-s-dan-schneider-now-is-he-in-jail-for-nickelodeon-abuse-claims.html&title=Wheres%20Dan%20Schneider%20Now%3f%20Is%20He%20in%20Jail%20For%20Nickelodeon%20Abuse%20Claims%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhere-s-dan-schneider-now-is-he-in-jail-for-nickelodeon-abuse-claims.html&title=Wheres%20Dan%20Schneider%20Now%3f%20Is%20He%20in%20Jail%20For%20Nickelodeon%20Abuse%20Claims%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhere-s-dan-schneider-now-is-he-in-jail-for-nickelodeon-abuse-claims.html&title=Wheres%20Dan%20Schneider%20Now%3f%20Is%20He%20in%20Jail%20For%20Nickelodeon%20Abuse%20Claims%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhere-s-dan-schneider-now-is-he-in-jail-for-nickelodeon-abuse-claims.html&description=Wheres%20Dan%20Schneider%20Now%3f%20Is%20He%20in%20Jail%20For%20Nickelodeon%20Abuse%20Claims%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-brittany-mcgraw-steve-o-s-ex-wife.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Brittany Mcgraw Steve-O's Ex-wife?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./see-video-hollywood-life.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="See Video  Hollywood Life">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
