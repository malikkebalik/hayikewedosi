Dwumfour's husband works as a pastor and identifies himself by the name Eze Kings on the social media site.</p><p>“4th March is your birthday happy glorious birthday in addy my love,” wrote Dwumfour’s husband. He attached almost a dozen photos of the couple which specifically showed Dwumfour’s wedding ring and also added a series of hearts in the post. The bizarre post has almost 150 comments, many of which expressed shock and disbelief at<a href=# rel> Dwumfour’s tragic death</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>California shooting: Noah David Beard and Angel Uriarte arrested for killing 6, including teen mom and 10-month-old boy</a></p><p><a href=# rel>Amir Locke death: Civil lawsuit filed a year after Minneapolis cops shot man, 22, in no-knock search warrant</a></p><h2 class=split><strong>What happened to Eunice Dwumfour?</strong></h2><p>An unknown gunman shot Dwumfour multiple times while she drove her white Nissan near the Camelot at the La Mer apartment complex. Authorities later arrived at the scene and pronounced her dead. Neither local police nor the <a href=# rel>Middlesex County</a> Prosecutor’s Office has come up with the name of any suspects, but according to the reports of &nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ABC7</a> in New York, investigators are looking into her ties to her husband’s church overseas in Nigeria, among other things.</p><p>The outlet said that police dogs were brought by the authorities to search the woods behind the apartment complex for the murder weapon. Neighbors alleged that they have seen the killer run toward the nearby Garden State Parkway.&nbsp;</p><p>According to<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> New York Post</a>, police claimed that the councilwoman was caught speaking to the killer just moments prior to her death. The family of the New York native said that they are cooperating with the local authorities as they probe to find out what happened on that night. “I can’t say anything about it unless [the investigation] is finished,” said Prince Dwumfour, the councilwoman’s father.&nbsp;</p><p>He paused and added, "All these things you’re asking, it will come out eventually," when was asked about when Dwumfour’s absent husband would be coming. The police department said that the investigation is still ongoing and they won't release any further details as of now.&nbsp;</p><p>One family friend who lives in the same apartment as Dwumfour’s parents, claims that Dwumfour might have been a victim of a racially motivated attack. “We all suggested that she doesn’t move down to that part of Jersey — we call that ‘clan land,’” said the friend, who would not give her name. “That was a hit. That was an assassination.”&nbsp;</p><p>Amos Martey, 52 who is another family friend from Ghana also believes that she was killed because of her race and position. “I believe color played a role,” Martey said. “I believe because she’s a minority. It might be related to her job … I might be wrong, but that’s how I feel. It breaks my heart.”&nbsp;</p><p>On Friday, February 3, the FBI's Newark field office issued a statement, saying that they were aware of Dwumfour’s death and were in contact with local law enforcement. “Should they ask us for any assistance, we will do all we can to help their investigation,” a spokesperson said in an email. The Republican councilwoman was the oldest of five children in a Ghanaian family and was the mother of an 11-year-old girl.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>Who is Eze Kings?</h2><p>Although not much is known about Eze Kings, the husband of the late councilwoman reportedly works as a pastor in Nigeria. It is also not known if Eze Kings is his real name or not. Kings married Dwumfour in November last year in Africa, according to her relatives.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5ikeqq%2FjJ6xnmWbnruov4yso5qhnmK7q3nCqKynm5mhxLC5wKeqZqClqK%2BiusNmp6irpKh6o7XRrZ%2BdmalixKq%2Fx2adqKpdnbKzecBmpKimpJ16qrqMmpuvmZ6Ysg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-eze-kings-slain-nj-councilwoman-s-husband-posts-birthday-wish-for-her-a-month-in-advance.html&text=Who%20is%20Eze%20Kings%3f%20Slain%20NJ%20councilwoman%27s%20husband%20posts%20birthday%20wish%20for%20her%20a%20month%20in%20advance&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-eze-kings-slain-nj-councilwoman-s-husband-posts-birthday-wish-for-her-a-month-in-advance.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-eze-kings-slain-nj-councilwoman-s-husband-posts-birthday-wish-for-her-a-month-in-advance.html&title=Who%20is%20Eze%20Kings%3f%20Slain%20NJ%20councilwoman%27s%20husband%20posts%20birthday%20wish%20for%20her%20a%20month%20in%20advance" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-eze-kings-slain-nj-councilwoman-s-husband-posts-birthday-wish-for-her-a-month-in-advance.html&title=Who%20is%20Eze%20Kings%3f%20Slain%20NJ%20councilwoman%27s%20husband%20posts%20birthday%20wish%20for%20her%20a%20month%20in%20advance" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-eze-kings-slain-nj-councilwoman-s-husband-posts-birthday-wish-for-her-a-month-in-advance.html&title=Who%20is%20Eze%20Kings%3f%20Slain%20NJ%20councilwoman%27s%20husband%20posts%20birthday%20wish%20for%20her%20a%20month%20in%20advance" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-eze-kings-slain-nj-councilwoman-s-husband-posts-birthday-wish-for-her-a-month-in-advance.html&description=Who%20is%20Eze%20Kings%3f%20Slain%20NJ%20councilwoman%27s%20husband%20posts%20birthday%20wish%20for%20her%20a%20month%20in%20advance" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./channing-tatum.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Channing Tatum">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./victim-statements-released-in-lori-vallow-daybell-case.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Victim statements released in Lori Vallow Daybell case">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
