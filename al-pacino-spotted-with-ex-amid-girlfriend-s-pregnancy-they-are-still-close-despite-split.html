The ex-couple was seen enjoying a family fun day with their son Anton James Pacino as they made their way to an escape room in Los Angeles. The family outing comes only a week after news had just broken concerning Pacino's current 29-year-old girlfriend being eight months pregnant with his fourth child.</p><p class=dh>As the family enjoyed spending time together, photographs showed a chicly dressed D'Angelo and a relaxed-looking Pacino <strong class=bh>in the middle of what looked to be a serious discussion</strong>. After wrapping up their conversation, the ex-couple proceeded to enter the escape room with their family.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>What the Beverly D'Angelo and Al Pacino's Family Reunion Looked Like</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Pictures of the <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-12186881/Al-Pacino-83-visits-escape-room-ex-Beverly-DAngelo-71-son-Anton-21.html>ex-partners reuniting</a> were splayed across every major news outlet. The family reunion was an all-black attire affair: D'Angelo adorned a black and white pinstriped t-shirt paired with black slacks, a black blazer, and black sneakers. Patriarch Pacino was clad in a black shirt, black joggers, and a black coat to match, while his son similarly wore a black shirt and black shorts with black New Balance shoes.</p><p class=dh>As the family continued to be photographed, viewers noticed how <strong class=bh>deeply engaged and happy Pacino appeared to be when communicating with his ex</strong>, even while the two were seated and involved in a serious chat at one point. When giving a recent account of their relationship history, D'Angelo boasted about how she and Pacino <strong class=bh>remain friends who share a unique bond that surpasses a traditional relationship</strong> to this day.</p><p class=dh>The "Violent Night" talent went on about how she and her ex have always been connected via a kinship with creative pursuits that has existed since the 90s. Apart from the special family moment, <strong class=bh>a new family member was noticeably absent from the festivities </strong>- Pacino's new flame, Noor Alfallah, who is set to welcome his fourth child later this year.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Where It All Started: Beverly D'Angelo and Al Pacino's Relationship History</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Pacino and D'Angelo's history has been filled with <strong class=bh>eventful feats that involved many ups and downs before leading to a split in 2004</strong>. On May 8, D'Angelo took to her Instagram to give fans some details about the relationship she shared/s with Pacino. According to D'Angelo, her <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-12062261/Beverly-DAngelo-opens-longtime-relationship-Al-Pacino-shares-twins-with.html>DM inbox</a> was getting flooded with all sorts of questions from fans wanting to know more about her romantic timeline with the "Scarface" actor.</p><p class=dh>Deciding to indulge the requests, D'Angelo began the story that showcased heartwarmingly nostalgic photos and videos of her, Pacino, and their twins as she narrated their history as a family. The ex-lovebirds met 27 years ago, in 1996, on a plane going from Los Angeles to New York. As soon as Pacino noticed D'Angelo, <strong class=bh>he knew she would one day become the mother of his future children</strong>.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>Pacino's recent appearance with his ex-partner D'Angelo was all about enjoying some family fun with their kids as friendly co-parents.</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/ed9cc0bd3b420b2459e6fd6914d4499dd41bf375bd02732b366697892a379e9b.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Al Pacino and Beverly D'Angelo at "The Insider" premiere in New York City, 1999 | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>The scene was set on the plane, Pacino was seated in front of D'Angelo, and she was sitting behind him. While continuing to tell the story, D'Angelo <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/Cr-8iwku5-d/>recalled</a>:</p><p class=dh><i class=ch>"He was seated in front of me, [and] he said come up and sit beside me, and by the time the plane landed, it was on. In 1997, he looked me in the eye and said, 'I want you to be the mother of my children.' "</i></p><p class=dh>D'Angelo admits that she had avoided becoming a mother all her life, but she was deeply in love with Pacino and committed to the actor 100%. Thus, <strong class=bh>their journey to parenthood began, and in 1997, they underwent their first round of IVF, and after a few attempts, the couple became parents to twins</strong> - Anton James and Olivia Rose Pacino in 2001.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/1f43ba07bd4f9af021a03e4467f87c06f784b012045345a94c7900aca60be568.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Beverly D'Angelo and Al Pacino spotted in Los Angeles, 2001 | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>After seven years of living together as a happy family, things became complicated, and the two ended up going their separate ways in 2004.
