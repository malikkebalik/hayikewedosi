The Ghost&nbsp;actress married the&nbsp;Die Hard&nbsp;actor in 1987. The two shared a quaint life raising their three <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>daughters</a> together in Hailey, Idaho. One of their daughters, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Rumer Willis</strong></a>, announced via <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> that she was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pregnant</a> in December 2022 with her boyfriend <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Derek Richard Thomas</strong></a>. Demi reacted on her own <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>, hilariously writing, “Entering my hot kooky unhinged grandma era.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Demi officially entered her “grandma era” on April 18, 2023 when<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Rumer gave birth</a> to her first child. “Louetta Isley Thomas Willis … You are pure magic,” she gushed in the below Instagram <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photo</a> of her daughter. “Born at home on Tuesday April 18th … You are more than we ever dreamed of”.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>As fans know, Demi and Bruce ultimately ended up getting divorced in 2000. The About Last Night&nbsp;actress went on to marry&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ashton Kutcher </strong></a>in 2005 but as we know, that didn’t last, and he’s now with his That ’70s Show&nbsp;co-star&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Mila Kunis</a></strong>. Bruce, meanwhile, has gone on to marry<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Emma Heming</a> </strong>and the two are still together to this day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Demi-Moores-Daughters-EMBED.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Demi and Bruce may not still be together but they are still very much involved with each other’s lives, especially co-parenting their girls. In fact, the divorced couple moved back into their family home in Idado with their three adult daughters to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>quarantine</a> as a happy family unit during the coronavirus pandemic. While it’s certainly not a situation most families of divorce could live through, they all seemed to thrive during this time. Here are the three daughters Bruce and Demi raised together.</p><h2>Rumer Glenn Willis</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Demi-Moores-Daughters-EMBED4.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>At this point in her career, Rumer is just as famous as her parents. The 34-year-old, who was born on Aug. 16, 1988, knew she wanted to follow in her parents’ footsteps at a young age as she attended Interlochen Arts Academy in Michigan as a kid. She has gone on to star in a number of films including Sorority Row, Hostage&nbsp;and&nbsp;The House Bunny.&nbsp;She also is a singer and recently showed off her vocal chops on The Masked Singer&nbsp;as Lion.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Even though her parents are divorced, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rumer</a> appreciates how hard they’ve worked to co-parent her and her sisters. “I’m incredibly grateful that both of my parents have made such an effort my entire life that I never felt like I had to choose between them,” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE.</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-10>“I have a lot of friends who grew up with parents who got divorced at a young age and I watched their parents, like, pit them against each other or have to choose between holidays,” she added. “And I didn’t have to do that, and I feel so grateful that my parents made it such a priority that we could be a family, even though it looked different.”</p><h2>Scout LaRue Willis</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Demi-Moores-Daughters-EMBED3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-11><strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Scout Willis</a>&nbsp;</strong>was born on July 20, 1991. Like her older sister, the 31-year-old moved to LA to pursue a career in acting and even had a role in her father’s film Bandits.&nbsp;Nowadays, her focus is geared toward singing, as proven in her posts on her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>. She released her first single called “Love Without Permission” in 2021.&nbsp;Speaking of music, Scout has been <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>dating her musician </a>beau <strong>Jake Miller </strong>for almost five years.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Demi doted on her daughter in a 2021 Instagram post for her 30th birthday. “You were already carving out your unique path when you decided to arrive 3.5 weeks early 30 years ago,” Demi captioned the post. “You continue to do so with every courageous, thoughtful, and meaningful move you make in this life. I learn from you everyday. I am inspired by you. I really like you. And I am honored to be your mother. Excited to be sharing this life with you. I love you madly!”</p><h2>Tallulah Belle Willis</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Demi-Moores-Daughters-EMBED2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-15><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Tallulah Willis</strong></a> was born on Feb. 3, 1994. The youngest of the Willis sisters also has a background in acting as she has starred in films like The Whole Ten Yards&nbsp;and also had a role in&nbsp;Bandits.&nbsp;Most recently, the 29-year-old launched a clothing line called <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Wyllis</a> that promotes body inclusivity. As for her personal life, she recently got engaged to film director <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Dillon Buss</a></strong>.&nbsp;He proposed on May 4, 2021 with a beautiful emerald engagement ring. She often shares adorable snaps of the couple on her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>She recently confessed to feeling <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>resentment</a> toward her father Bruce. “I punished myself for not looking like my mom [Demi Moore] after being told I was [my dad, Bruce Willis‘] twin since birth,” Tallulah admitted in an Instagram post. “I resented the resemblance as I believed wholly my ‘masculine’ face was the sole reason for my unlovability.” Fortunately, it seems she has embraced her appearance and gotten over her past insecurities.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8OepKJlnaS8s7GMnZiun5ipsrO%2FjGtkbW5iZYVxhI4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ffacts-about-her-girls-including-pregnant-rumer-hollywood-life.html&text=Facts%20About%20Her%20Girls%20Including%20Pregnant%20Rumer%20%20Hollywood%20Life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffacts-about-her-girls-including-pregnant-rumer-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffacts-about-her-girls-including-pregnant-rumer-hollywood-life.html&title=Facts%20About%20Her%20Girls%20Including%20Pregnant%20Rumer%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ffacts-about-her-girls-including-pregnant-rumer-hollywood-life.html&title=Facts%20About%20Her%20Girls%20Including%20Pregnant%20Rumer%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ffacts-about-her-girls-including-pregnant-rumer-hollywood-life.html&title=Facts%20About%20Her%20Girls%20Including%20Pregnant%20Rumer%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffacts-about-her-girls-including-pregnant-rumer-hollywood-life.html&description=Facts%20About%20Her%20Girls%20Including%20Pregnant%20Rumer%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./joshua-dobbs-bio-net-worth-career-wife-age-parents.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Joshua Dobbs Bio, Net Worth, Career, Wife, Age &amp;amp; Parents">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./caitlin-ej-meyer-bio-age-wiki-facts-and-family.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Caitlin EJ Meyer - Bio, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
