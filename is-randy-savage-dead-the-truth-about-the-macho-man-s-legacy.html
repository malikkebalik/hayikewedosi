He was known for his flamboyant ring attire, his raspy voice, his signature catchphrase “Oooh yeah!”, and his legendary feuds and matches with Hulk Hogan, Ric Flair, Ultimate Warrior, and many others. He was a six-time world champion, a WWE Hall of Famer, and a pop culture phenomenon. But is Randy Savage dead? And if so, how did he die? Here is the truth about the Macho Man’s life and legacy.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Early Life and Career</h3><p>Randy Savage was born as Randy Mario Poffo on November 15, 1952, in Columbus, Ohio. His father, Angelo Poffo, was a well-known wrestler in the 1950s and 1960s, and his younger brother, Lanny Poffo, also became a wrestler. Randy was a talented athlete who pursued a career as a professional baseball player before turning to wrestling in the 1970s. He played in the minor leagues for several teams, including the St. Louis Cardinals and the Cincinnati Reds, but never made it to the majors. He then followed his father’s footsteps and joined the wrestling business, adopting the ring name “Randy Savage” on the recommendation of his trainer, Terry Stephens. He also used other names, such as “The Spider”, “The Big Geno”, “Mr. Madness”, “Destroyer”, “Executioner”, and “Bonesaw”.</p><p>Savage started his wrestling career in various territories, such as Georgia Championship Wrestling, International Championship Wrestling, Mid-South Wrestling, and World Class Championship Wrestling. He gained popularity and recognition for his charismatic persona, his intense promos, his high-flying moves, and his innovative style. He also met his future wife and manager, Elizabeth Hulette, better known as “Miss Elizabeth”, in ICW. They married in 1984 and became one of the most famous couples in wrestling history.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>WWE Stardom and Feuds</h3><p>Savage joined the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, later WWE) in 1985 and quickly rose to stardom. He was paired with Miss Elizabeth, who became his valet and on-screen love interest. He won his first major title, the WWF Intercontinental Championship, by defeating Tito Santana in February 1986. He then engaged in a memorable feud with Ricky “The Dragon” Steamboat, culminating in a classic match at WrestleMania III in March 1987, which Savage lost. He then won the 1987 King of the Ring tournament and became a fan favorite.</p><p>Savage reached the pinnacle of his career when he won the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania IV in March 1988, defeating Ted DiBiase in the finals of a tournament. He then formed a tag team with Hulk Hogan, called “The Mega Powers”, and feuded with the likes of Andre the Giant, The Million Dollar Man, and The Twin Towers. However, the Mega Powers soon imploded, as Savage became jealous of Hogan’s friendship with Miss Elizabeth. This led to a heated rivalry between the two, which resulted in Savage losing the title to Hogan at WrestleMania V in April 1989. Savage then turned heel and adopted the moniker of “Macho King”, with Sensational Sherri as his new manager. He feuded with Hogan, Dusty Rhodes, The Ultimate Warrior, and Jake “The Snake” Roberts, among others.</p><p>Savage regained the WWF World Heavyweight Championship by defeating Ric Flair at WrestleMania VIII in April 1992, with Miss Elizabeth returning to his side. He then turned face again and reconciled with Hogan, forming “The Mega Maniacs”. He also married Miss Elizabeth in a televised ceremony, dubbed “The Match Made in Heaven”, at SummerSlam in August 1991. However, this was only a storyline, as they had divorced in real life in 1992. Savage then lost the title to Flair in September 1992 and entered a semi-retirement phase, becoming a commentator and occasional wrestler. He left the WWF in 1994, after being unhappy with his reduced role and creative direction.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>WCW Success and Controversies</h3><p>Savage joined World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 1994 and became a major star in the promotion. He won the WCW World Heavyweight Championship four times, feuding with Flair, Hogan, Sting, Diamond Dallas Page, Kevin Nash, and others. He also joined the New World Order (nWo), a heel faction led by Hogan, in 1997, and later formed his own splinter group, the nWo Wolfpac, in 1998. He also introduced his new girlfriend and manager, Gorgeous George, who was followed by other valets, such as Miss Madness and Madusa.</p><p>Savage’s WCW run was marred by several controversies and problems, such as backstage politics, creative differences, injuries, and personal issues. He had a bitter falling out with Hogan, who he accused of sabotaging his career and having an affair with Miss Elizabeth, who had joined WCW in 1996. He also had a tumultuous relationship with Gorgeous George, who he allegedly abused and cheated on. He also became more erratic and paranoid, as he bulked up his physique and changed his appearance. He left WCW in 2000, after the company was bought by WWE.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Retirement and Death</h3><p>Savage retired from wrestling in 2000, after a brief stint in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). He then focused on other ventures, such as acting, rap music, and video games. He appeared in several movies and TV shows, such as Spider-Man, Ready to Rumble, Baywatch, and King of the Hill. He also released a rap album, called Be a Man, in 2003, which featured diss tracks aimed at Hogan and Flair. He also lent his voice and likeness to several video games, such as WWE 2K14, WWE 2K16, and WWE 2K18.</p><p>Savage remarried in 2010, to Lynn Payne, a childhood friend. He died on May 20, 2011, at the age of 58, after suffering a heart attack while driving his Jeep Wrangler in Seminole, Florida. He lost control of the vehicle and crashed into a tree, but his wife, who was in the passenger seat, survived with minor injuries. An autopsy revealed that Savage had an enlarged heart and advanced coronary artery disease, which caused the heart attack. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered under his favorite tree by his brother.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Legacy and Honors</h3><p>Savage is widely regarded as one of the greatest wrestlers of all time, and one of the most influential and popular figures in the history of the sport. He is credited for bringing a higher level of credibility, athleticism, and entertainment to the wrestling industry, and for inspiring generations of wrestlers and fans. He is also recognized for his contributions to pop culture, as he became a household name and a crossover star. He is known for his memorable catchphrases, such as “Oooh yeah!”, “Snap into a Slim Jim!”, and “The cream of the crop!”, which are still used and referenced today.</p><p>Savage was inducted into several halls of fame and received numerous awards and accolades for his wrestling career. He was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2015, by his longtime friend and rival, Hulk Hogan. He was also inducted into the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame in 1996, the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame in 2009, and the St. Louis Wrestling Hall of Fame in 2012. He was also ranked No. 2 on WWE’s list of the 50 Greatest Intercontinental Champions of All Time, No. 9 on WWE’s list of the 100 Greatest Wrestlers of the 90s, and No. 29 on WWE’s list of the Top 50 Superstars of All Time.</p><p>Is Randy Savage dead? Yes, he is. But his legacy lives on, as he is remembered and celebrated by millions of fans around the world. He was a Macho Man, a legend, and a icon. Oooh yeah!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmZh6rrHRnJ%2BapqRjsLC5jpuss7JfnsBuvsCnm7Jlo5bDorPEZpuemZRiwamxjK2prqyYYq6ju9StZK2glWK6oq%2FHqGSmmZ6oeq2xxpqasmc%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fis-randy-savage-dead-the-truth-about-the-macho-man-s-legacy.html&text=Is%20Randy%20Savage%20Dead%3f%20The%20Truth%20About%20the%20Macho%20Mans%20Legacy&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-randy-savage-dead-the-truth-about-the-macho-man-s-legacy.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-randy-savage-dead-the-truth-about-the-macho-man-s-legacy.html&title=Is%20Randy%20Savage%20Dead%3f%20The%20Truth%20About%20the%20Macho%20Mans%20Legacy" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fis-randy-savage-dead-the-truth-about-the-macho-man-s-legacy.html&title=Is%20Randy%20Savage%20Dead%3f%20The%20Truth%20About%20the%20Macho%20Mans%20Legacy" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fis-randy-savage-dead-the-truth-about-the-macho-man-s-legacy.html&title=Is%20Randy%20Savage%20Dead%3f%20The%20Truth%20About%20the%20Macho%20Mans%20Legacy" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-randy-savage-dead-the-truth-about-the-macho-man-s-legacy.html&description=Is%20Randy%20Savage%20Dead%3f%20The%20Truth%20About%20the%20Macho%20Mans%20Legacy" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./joe-murgo-net-worth-why-did-he-leave-wtaj-meteorologist-family-explore.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Joe Murgo Net Worth: Why Did He Leave WTAJ?
