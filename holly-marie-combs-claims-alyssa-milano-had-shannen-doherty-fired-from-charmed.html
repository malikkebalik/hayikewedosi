She didn’t want to do it without me. Therefore, I don’t want to do it without her and that should be fairly clear,” she recalled saying.</p><p><strong>For more Page Six you love …</strong></p><p>According to Combs, Levin responded to her ultimatum with what “felt like blackmail” as he threatened to sue her if she quit.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-full">She recalled finding out about the news in an emotional meeting with show producer Jonathan Levin. <span class=credit>©Viacom/Courtesy Everett Collect</span></figure><p>Doherty’s character, Prue Halliwell, was killed off in the Season 3 finale in 2001, and she was later replaced by Rose McGowan’s character, Paige.</p><p>The “Beverly Hills, 90210” alum recalled the pain and confusion she felt after getting fired.</p><p>“I lived a year after that sort of replaying everything in my brain and really trying to find those moments [of alleged bad behavior on set] — and I couldn’t find them,” said Doherty, 52.</p><p>“I don’t ever remember being mean to her on set. I remember an episode I directed where she did something on the Christmas break and they asked me to work around some things with her and I had no problem with it. I couldn’t have been more kind and understanding,” Doherty continued.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-full">“We’ve been backed into this corner — we’re basically in this position where it’s one or the other,” Combs recalled Levin telling her. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>The “Heathers” star — who was 30 when she left the show — said she wishes she had been “older and wiser” enough to handle the situation differently.</p><p>“I definitely would’ve sued and I would’ve been honest about the situation because the rumors followed me regardless,” she said.</p><p>While Doherty has moved on with her life, she still hasn’t forgiven and forgotten.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-full">The actress added that Milano built her case by documenting “every time she felt uncomfortable on set.” <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>“As you get older, you accept that a situation happened. Acceptance and moving on with your life does not equate to forgiveness,” the podcaster continued. “You just learn a lesson and look at somebody differently and move on.”</p><p>Reps for Milano weren’t immediately available to Page Six for a comment.</p><p>Meanwhile, Doherty initially opened up about her strained relationship with Milano, 50, during part one of the podcast episode with Combs last week.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-full">Combs allegedly even threatened to leave the show in retaliation but was allegedly told she would be sued. <span class=credit>GJimenez</span></figure><p>Doherty claimed she was<a href=#> prevented from visiting Combs in the hospital</a> in the late 1990s by the “Who’s the Boss” star and her mom.</p><p>“Hospitals scared me to death. I waited 24 hours after your surgery to go, and then it wasn’t even easy for me to get in. I was, like, being told I couldn’t even get in,” Doherty recalled.</p><p>“Alyssa and her mom were blocking people from seeing you, and at the time you didn’t know. I remember you texted me, ‘Dude, are you going to come and see me?’”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Doherty couldn’t recall treating Milano poorly while on set. <span class=credit>Getty Images for Hallmark Channel</span></figure><p>Milano has since admitted she regrets how she treated Doherty and&nbsp;<a href=#>lives with “guilt”</a>&nbsp;from the past.</p><p>“You know, I could take responsibility for a lot of our tension that we had,” she told E!’s “Daily Pop” in 2017, adding she was in <a href=#>communication with her former co-star</a> at the time.</p><p>“I think a lot of our struggle came from feeling that I was in competition rather than it being that sisterhood that the show was so much about. And I have some guilt about my part in that.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiokZyytLXXZ5qopV9nfXN%2FjmppaGloZLKvwMSrq5qhnqKyr8COoaalpKliuqK%2ByJ5knKedl8Bur86nnaKqnah6orjYrKqaZZ2euaK6zmafmpxdqLWius2epWacn52ys8DYZp2iqpWZeqe%2BzqZknKCRp7qmsI4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fholly-marie-combs-claims-alyssa-milano-had-shannen-doherty-fired-from-charmed.html&text=Holly%20Marie%20Combs%20claims%20Alyssa%20Milano%20had%20Shannen%20Doherty%20fired%20from%20%27Charmed%27&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fholly-marie-combs-claims-alyssa-milano-had-shannen-doherty-fired-from-charmed.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fholly-marie-combs-claims-alyssa-milano-had-shannen-doherty-fired-from-charmed.html&title=Holly%20Marie%20Combs%20claims%20Alyssa%20Milano%20had%20Shannen%20Doherty%20fired%20from%20%27Charmed%27" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fholly-marie-combs-claims-alyssa-milano-had-shannen-doherty-fired-from-charmed.html&title=Holly%20Marie%20Combs%20claims%20Alyssa%20Milano%20had%20Shannen%20Doherty%20fired%20from%20%27Charmed%27" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fholly-marie-combs-claims-alyssa-milano-had-shannen-doherty-fired-from-charmed.html&title=Holly%20Marie%20Combs%20claims%20Alyssa%20Milano%20had%20Shannen%20Doherty%20fired%20from%20%27Charmed%27" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fholly-marie-combs-claims-alyssa-milano-had-shannen-doherty-fired-from-charmed.html&description=Holly%20Marie%20Combs%20claims%20Alyssa%20Milano%20had%20Shannen%20Doherty%20fired%20from%20%27Charmed%27" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jeffrey-archer-s-career-and-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jeffrey Archer's Career and Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./fredrick-baker-obituary-a-life-lived-with-passion-and-purpose-death.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fredrick Baker Obituary, A Life Lived With Passion And Purpose  Death">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
