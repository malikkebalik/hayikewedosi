Brittany and Steve-O began dating in December 2006. They dated for roughly one year before making things official in January 2008. They, however, divorced just after a year.</strong></p><p>Steve-O’s ex-wife is an American actress and model born May 1, 1986. Although it’s clear that the 37 year-old’s marriage to Steve-O was the sole reason for her fame, she did have a successful career of her own as an adult and glamor model. She also starred in the 2009 film Endless Bummer.</p><h3><strong>Brittany McGraw’s Bio</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>AGE:</strong> 37 Years Old</li><li><strong>BIRTHDAY:</strong> May 1, 1986</li><li><strong>BIRTHPLACE:</strong> Los Angeles, California, United States</li><li><strong>BIRTH SIGN:</strong> Taurus</li><li><strong>ETHNICITY:</strong> Caucasian</li></ul><h2><strong>Brittany McGraw is Presently 37 Years Old</strong></h2><p>Brittany McGraw was born on May 1, 1986, in Los Angeles, California, to American parents. She is of American nationality and Caucasian ethnicity. She also was born under the Taurus zodiac sun sign.</p><p>While we know that Brittany’s parents are both White and American, there is sadly very little else that can be revealed about them. In the same manner, Brittany McGraw’s siblings’ identities, if she has any, haven’t been mentioned in public.</p><h3><strong><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/100382131417814104055766-1.jpg alt="Brittany McGraw" width=696 height=447 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></strong></h3><p>With her long blonde hair, green eyes, and slim figure, Brittany is the classic American showgirl. She stands at an above-average height of 5 feet 7 inches and an ample weight of 60 kg. Her tan skin is very usual among the ladies of California, who are believed to spend a lot of time in the sun. This is because California has a lot of beaches where people surf, swim or generally sunbathe.</p><p>As someone who was born and raised in Los Angeles, Brittany had a typical American education and was reported to have attended a private school in Los Angeles. However, the name of the school she attended is not public information. Unconfirmed sources have reported that she is very well educated though, and has a college degree from a prestigious university.</p><p>Brittany McGraw prefers to keep her private life away from the public, especially regarding her childhood and upbringing. Hopefully, she might decide to shed a little more light on her life as a child soon.</p><h2><strong>Brittany McGraw was Steve-O’s Wife Over A Decade Ago in 2008</strong></h2><p>Although no longer as popular, Steve-O was the “showboy” of the early 2000s. With shows like Don’t Try This At Home 1&2 and the very popular Jackass movies under his belt, he was definitely hogging lots of attention in those years. So it’s not surprising that his love life was also a constant source of entertainment in those days.</p><p>Before he got with Brittany, the actor had just come out of a very messy divorce with ex-wife Candy-Jane Tucker, whom he divorced in 2003. Brittany McGraw and Steve-O began dating in December 2006. Details about exactly when and where they met have been left out, but it’s likely they met through mutual friends who worked in Hollywood.</p><p>At the time of their meeting, Brittany McGraw was only 21 years old, while Steve-O was 12 years older at 33. They dated for roughly one year before deciding to make things official in January 2008. Throughout their dating, countless pictures were taken of the pair whenever they attended public functions together.</p><p>Their wedding, which took place early in 2008, was a private affair with only close friends and family members in attendance. Sadly, they split up not too long after tying the nuptial knot. Some might have said that Steve-O moved on too soon after the demise of his first marriage. It didn’t matter much in the end because his second marriage didn’t last either. By the end of 2008, McGraw and Steve-O were officially divorced.</p><h3><strong>The Couple Divorced Less Than One Year After Being Married</strong></h3><p>It was said that Brittany decided to end her marriage to Steve-O because she didn’t like the dangerous stunts he performed for a living. It was also believed that the actor and stuntman had been deliberately putting himself in harm’s way due to the effect of mental issues caused by his drug habits.</p><p>While neither Brittany nor Steve-O ever came out to tell the truth about their unexpected divorce, the fact was that their marriage was done for good. Brittany and Steve-O don’t share any kids, and their divorce was concluded smoothly because of this. Since they have no kids, their split wasn’t a messy one as there was no need for child support or alimony. Presently, neither of them has any kids.</p><h2><strong>Where is Steve-O’s Ex-wife Now?</strong></h2><p>Brittany McGraw was 26 years old when she became single again. After her split from Steve-O in 2008, she decided to give acting a try and appeared in the 2009 Sam Pillsbury-directed comedy film, Endless Bummer. In the movie, McGraw made a brief cameo appearance as a beach girl, as the movie was set and filmed in Los Angeles, California.</p><p>The movie featured other actors like Jim Piddock, Khan Chittenden, Jane Leeves, Ray Santiago, and Vanessa Angel. Her appearance in this film was Brittany McGraw’s first and only television appearance to date.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/100382131417814104055766-1.jpg><p>It is also recorded that Brittany was a fashion and glamor model and worked exclusively with well-known adult brands like Playboy. However, it seems like she decided to quit her modeling career. There are no further records of Brittany McGraw’s modeling career anywhere on the internet, leading to the conclusion that, much like her acting, she wasn’t very successful as a Hollywood model.</p><p>Still, in 2022, Brittany seems to have moved on from all the drama in the 2000s nicely. There are reports that she has since gotten remarried, but there is no information on the identity of her new husband. More importantly, these rumors haven’t been confirmed by a reputable source yet.</p><p>On the other hand, Steve-O has more than moved on. The Jackass star is engaged to American producer and screenwriter Lux Wright. The pair got engaged in 2018 and were supposed to have gotten married in 2020 but had to push back their wedding plans due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Before Lux, Steve was notably in relationships with a host of other women, including Stacey Solomon (2015),&nbsp; Elisabetta Canalis (2012), Lacey Schwimmer (2009), and Katherine von Drachenberg (2007 – 2016). Brittany isn’t active on any social media platform at the moment and prefers to lay low and keep her private life away from the spotlight.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZ60qcDLoqWeZpOkunDDx6hkoqtdl7%2BqwNOapbJlnZi0s63WZqqtnaaaerC%2FjJ6vZq%2BZm7Jw</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-brittany-mcgraw-steve-o-s-ex-wife.html&text=Who%20Is%20Brittany%20Mcgraw%20Steve-O%27s%20Ex-wife%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-brittany-mcgraw-steve-o-s-ex-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-brittany-mcgraw-steve-o-s-ex-wife.html&title=Who%20Is%20Brittany%20Mcgraw%20Steve-O%27s%20Ex-wife%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-brittany-mcgraw-steve-o-s-ex-wife.html&title=Who%20Is%20Brittany%20Mcgraw%20Steve-O%27s%20Ex-wife%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-brittany-mcgraw-steve-o-s-ex-wife.html&title=Who%20Is%20Brittany%20Mcgraw%20Steve-O%27s%20Ex-wife%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-brittany-mcgraw-steve-o-s-ex-wife.html&description=Who%20Is%20Brittany%20Mcgraw%20Steve-O%27s%20Ex-wife%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./coco-gauff-wiki-boyfriend-height-net-worth-career.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Coco Gauff- Wiki, Boyfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./where-s-dan-schneider-now-is-he-in-jail-for-nickelodeon-abuse-claims.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Wheres Dan Schneider Now?
