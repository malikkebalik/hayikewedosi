I’m hoping there will be something to address her anger coming up.</p><p>For Thanksgiving, I thought Monica looked beautiful. Maybe they are doing different things in the makeup department depending upon the scene she’s playing in. Like maybe they make her eyes darker and more “harsh” when she’s about to rip into someone.</p><p>I still think she’s a beautiful women. The difference I notice is I think she may have gotten something done with her teeth. We all age differently. I think what’s more important is your inner beauty and Leslie Charleson, for all things I’ve read, is a wonderful, giving, caring, beautiful person.</p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>alikat</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>December 4, 2011, 8:40pm <span itemprop=position>4</span></span><p>They have really revamped the hypocritical biotch in Monica.</p><p>In one minute she tells Steve and Patrick that they needed to act like professionals around here</p><p>“At the moment, between the three of us, I’m the only one who hasn’t slept with Lisa Niles”</p><p>Then in the next breath she walks up and smacks the hell out of Luke “Congratulations on caving your grandson, whack THAT’S for killing mine.”</p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>alikat</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>December 4, 2011, 8:42pm <span itemprop=position>5</span></span><p>The funny part is Luke hit and killed Jake while drinking and driving.</p><p>Monica hit and seriously injured Sam while drinking and driving.</p><p>Guess she forgot about that!!!1</p><p>I love Monica’s character and wish they would bring more of her and the Q’s actually back from the dead.

I’m right there up in age with Monica and Tracy and Monica must of have had alot of plastic surgery, they think they look nice, but like others like me,to me it looks like a train wreck, Tracy aged so well so pretty but Leslie thought she did what was best for her,… I guess. :~</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmpp2jqK6osYybppqqlKh8tXvMqKWim5Goeq%2Bx1majqKebZIBxg5NxaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmonica-s-new-look-general-hospital.html&text=MONICA%27S%20NEW%20LOOK%20-%20General%20Hospital&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmonica-s-new-look-general-hospital.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmonica-s-new-look-general-hospital.html&title=MONICA%27S%20NEW%20LOOK%20-%20General%20Hospital" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmonica-s-new-look-general-hospital.html&title=MONICA%27S%20NEW%20LOOK%20-%20General%20Hospital" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmonica-s-new-look-general-hospital.html&title=MONICA%27S%20NEW%20LOOK%20-%20General%20Hospital" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmonica-s-new-look-general-hospital.html&description=MONICA%27S%20NEW%20LOOK%20-%20General%20Hospital" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-happened-to-writer-and-co-founder-of-empact-the-talks-today.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Happened To Writer And Co-Founder Of Empact The Talks Today">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./man-city-will-repeat-akanji-and-ake-s-technique-to-handle-mahrez-departure.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Man City Will Repeat Akanji And Ake's Technique To Handle Mahrez Departure">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
