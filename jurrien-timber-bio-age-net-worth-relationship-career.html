The center-back, who is only 21 years old, is well known for his excellent defending.</strong></p><p>The young man has distinguished himself as one of the best players for the Dutch side. Most defenders must be older and on the larger side to tackle and intercept the strikers.</p><p>Despite this requirement, Timber (Tim) is excellent and even more so has the potential to be a standout defender. The center-back has additionally won awards like Player of the Year and Talent of the Month.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_Worth_of_Jurrien_Timber_Salary_Earnings>What is the Net Worth of Jurrien Timber? Salary, Earnings</span></h2><p>Players in football make a lot of money because the sport is a huge industry worth billions of dollars. The center-back’s weekly pay, according to salary-sport, is close to $24,000.</p><p>With this tremendous sum of money, he becomes a millionaire every year. Additionally, he has a remarkable 45 million dollar market worth on the transfer market. Jurrien Timber is thought to have a net worth of 1.8 million euros.</p><p>Despite earning such a high wage, Jurrien leads a very simple and modest existence. He only ever rides a fashionable bike.</p><p>It is a great alternative to vehicles and motorcycles even though it is not mechanical. He is only ever seen with a caddy, which he used to transport his twin when traveling.</p><h2><span id=Where_was_Jurrien_Timber_born_Ethnicity_Nationality_Family_Education>Where was Jurrien Timber born? Ethnicity, Nationality, Family, Education</span></h2><p>Jurrien Timber, also known as Tim, was born on June 17, 2001. His family had six people in total, including five brothers.</p><p>Tim had a second identical twin named Quentin. The Duo was founded in the Dutch city of Utrecht. His mother, Marilyn, always supported and loved the boys throughout their childhood.</p><p>The deepest bonds exist between brothers. The twins Quentin and Jurrien lived up to this truth. They grew up together, sharing a room, sitting at the same table, and dressing similarly.</p><p>The two were even the same in their love of soccer. The twins were well-known in the neighborhood due to their status as identical twins and their football prowess.</p><p>Marilyn persisted in assisting the young players since it was impossible to ignore their football prowess. The two had a successful start to their football careers because of their mother’s support.</p><p>Despite being a single mother, Marilyn raised her children well and made sure they had a good education. Because Marilyn was a devoted woman, she enrolled them in a Catholic school.</p><p>Jurrien and Quentin attended De Spits Primary School in Bunnik Utrecht. Jurrien achieved great success in both studies and sports. Quinten, Jurrien’s twin, asserted that Jurrien usually obtained good grades even though Quinten studied more frequently.</p><p>The brothers never finished their further education because of their athletic activities.</p><p>Tim and Jurrien are both Black Dutch, also known as Argo-Dutch. His parents are from Carrabie originally. His mother is also of Arauban ancestry. Thus, Jurrien’s origins are Sub-Saharan, Carrabiean, Curacoa, and Aruban.</p><p>The history of the Jurrien family is extensive. Her mother, Marilyn, used to live in Curacao. She was born into a strict five-member Afro-Curacoan household and was raised there.</p><p>Given that they were solely Catholic, Marilyn was initially exposed to Christian music. She began to like dancing and listening to music.</p><h2><span id=Quick_Facts>Quick Facts</span></h2><table style="width:80%;margin:0 auto"><tbody><tr><td width=198><strong>Full name</strong></td><td width=426>Jurrien David Norman Timber</td></tr><tr><td width=198><strong>Nickname</strong></td><td width=426>Jurrien Timber</td></tr><tr><td width=198><strong>Date of Birth</strong></td><td width=426>17 June 2001</td></tr><tr><td width=198><strong>Birthplace</strong></td><td width=426>Utrecht, Netherlands</td></tr><tr><td width=198><strong>Age</strong></td><td width=426>21</td></tr><tr><td width=198><strong>Zodiac Sign</strong></td><td width=426>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td width=198><strong>Father’s name</strong></td><td width=426>Mr. Maduro</td></tr><tr><td width=198><strong>Mother’s name</strong></td><td width=426>Marilyn Timber</td></tr><tr><td width=198><strong>Siblings</strong></td><td width=426>4</td></tr><tr><td width=198><strong>Sister’s name</strong></td><td width=426>Quinten (Twin), Shamier, Chris, and Dylan</td></tr><tr><td width=198><strong>Nationality</strong></td><td width=426>Dutch</td></tr><tr><td width=198><strong>Height</strong></td><td width=426>5 feet 10 inches (1.79 m)</td></tr><tr><td width=198><strong>Weight</strong></td><td width=426>79 Kg ( 174 lbs)</td></tr><tr><td width=198><strong>Sexuality</strong></td><td width=426>Straight</td></tr><tr><td width=198><strong>Marital status</strong></td><td width=426>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td width=198><strong>Wife</strong></td><td width=426>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td width=198><strong>Children</strong></td><td width=426>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td width=198><strong>Net worth</strong></td><td width=426><strong>1.8 million Euros</strong></td></tr><tr><td width=198><strong>Salary</strong></td><td width=426><strong>900 thousand euros annually</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span id=Is_Jurrien_Timber_Single_Relationship>Is Jurrien Timber Single? Relationship</span></h2><p>Since the young man’s career got going, speculation about his romantic life has become very popular. Rumors about Jurrien’s romantic life will spread because of his attractiveness and youth. To find out more, let’s look at the center-back rumors.</p><p>Jurrien is not thought to be romantically attached right now. He is quite private about his love life, so unless someone saw him with her, we wouldn’t know if he had a girlfriend.</p><p>He is said to be a straight man. We currently just have a wide range of rumors and assumptions.</p><h2><span id=How_tall_is_Jurrien_Timber_Weight_Hair_Color>How tall is Jurrien Timber? Weight, Hair Color</span></h2><p>Timber is 79 kg (174 pounds) and 21 years old. The child is protected despite being so young. Defensive roles are often filled by people who are a little older and bigger to stop the strikers in their tracks.</p><p>Being a defender at this young age implies huge future potential. Aron Winter, Ruud Krol, Ruud Gullit, Frank de Boer, Virgil van Dijk, and Jaap Sta are just a few of the notable defenders who were born in the Netherlands.</p><p>Even just being compared to them is an incredible accomplishment. He most likely has a muscular physique that appears athletic and in good shape as a result.</p><h2><span id=How_did_Jurrien_Timber_start_his_Professional_Career>How did Jurrien Timber start his Professional Career?</span></h2><p>In addition to working, Jurrien likes to play video games and listen to music. He enjoys playing board games like dominoes.</p><p>Jurrien prefers the hip-hop and Caribbean music of their parents’ native nations. Tim’s favorite musical artists are Drake, Lil Baby, and Dutch singers like Broederliefde and Jonna Fraser.</p><p>Jurrien invested in his board game, as can be seen in the CAPTION. Jurrien often speaks in his sleep, as his identical twin Quentin reported.</p><p>She persisted in dancing and eventually found another love via it; they later got married. She shared him with the Twins, Dylan, Jurrien, and Quentin. Christopher and Shamier, their stepbrothers (they had a dad in common), were not their biological brothers.</p><p>They nevertheless continued to be as near as real ones. Things went from bad to worse when the father of the twins decided to move back to Curacao in quest of a warmer lifestyle.</p><p>At first, it was only temporary, but he never returned. She now had to take care of not just two, but five sons, which was another tragic development.</p><p>Her sister June Timber helped her a lot during these tough times. As a result, the children took on their mother’s last name.</p><p>At the moment, Quentin is a defender for his hometown team, Utrecht FC. The same team’s 2000-born center-back Dylan is his brother and plays for them.</p><p>The brothers and sisters seem to have been bred from birth to be defenders. Both of them and their half-brothers attempted football. The sibling who taught the young boys how to play soccer is how Christoper wishes to be known. Jurrien is 11 years younger than you. The half-brother works in IT and is in a relationship with a Dutch woman.</p><p>Before the twins, Quentin, the other half, was thought of as the family’s best football player. Even Utereh FC took notice of him.</p><p>He eventually decided that he was not cut out for football and transferred to the IT sector. Quentin and his girlfriend Marisol got engaged at the start of 2022.</p><p>Marilyn and the brothers, who come from a family of football players and IT professionals, are incredibly proud of one another for sticking together and succeeding in life.</p><p>The twins’ mother regularly supported the two of them as they improved their football abilities, along with Dylan. They were permitted entry into the DVSU academy at the age of four.</p><p>Two years later, they moved to Feyenoord Academy. Marilyn found it easier to keep an eye on the kids at Feyenoord than at the other academy.</p><p>The twins participated in school football. They were the team’s most valuable player and the best performer. They occasionally had to participate in a Feyenoord or School game due to scheduling conflicts.</p><p>The brothers joining Ajax in 2014 was a huge change. Feyenoord’s opponent, Ajax, surely caused disappointment and received poorly. The pair struggled in their first season with Ajax since they were regularly injured.</p><p>Timber debuted for Ajax on March 7, 2020. This was for the senior team, and SC Heerenveen was defeated 3-1 as a consequence. He scored his first goal for Ajax ever on May 2, 2021.</p><p>He was the game’s opening scorer as it snowballed into a 4-0 victory over Emmen. For the 35th time, Ajax won the Eredivisie championship after this decisive game.</p><p>The Netherlands will field Jurrien in the 2022 World Cup. Everyone wants to see the center-back perform at his peak for his nation.</p><p>At the U-17 level, the twins were selected for their first national contest. Being a member of the Netherlands U17 team was a significant accomplishment. After that, they received an invitation to compete in the 2018 UFEA European U17 Championship.</p><p>They then defeated Italy in a penalty shootout to win the championship. Jurrien was in charge of the 1–0 triumph. Additionally, Timber was chosen for the 2020 UEFA Euro Cup.</p><p>On June 2, 2021, the team’s center-back played in his first game against Scotland in a friendly. His biggest international encounter was the 2022 World Cup, one of his six appearances.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, Aeko Catori Brown, Jordana Lajoie, and Cogeian Sky Embry."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1053569,"3":{"1":0},"10":2,"11":0,"12":0,"15":"Arial","23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":28}{"1":30,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":44}{"1":50,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":67}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/aeko-catori-brown/"}{"1":28}{"1":30,"2":"https://popularbio.com/jordana-lajoie/"}{"1":44}{"1":50,"2":"https://popularbio.com/cogeian-sky-embry/"}{"1":67}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Aeko Catori Brown</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Jordana Lajoie</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Cogeian Sky Embry</a>.</span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Football Player</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Adriana Leon Married | Partner | Relationship History</a></h3>Adriana Leon's boyfriend has become the most sought-after topic on the internet, with many people wondering if she is dating anyone as of 2023.
