Despite her promising career and huge salaries, her life took a downward spiral due to drug issues, wild parties, weird public behavior, family issues, and a general malaise.</p><p>Starting at the age of three, Lohan acted in commercials and starred in some of Hollywood’s most popular films of the early 2000s, including “The Parent Trap”, “Freaky Friday”, and “Mean Girls”. She even released a successful album. However, much of her $28 million fortune earned from movie salaries is now gone.</p><h2><span id=Lindsay_Lohans_Early_Life>Lindsay Lohan’s Early Life</span></h2><p>Lindsay Lohan was born on July 2, 1986, in New York City. She grew up on Long Island, New York. Her father is a former Wall Street trader who has been in trouble with the law on several occasions. Her mother is a former singer and dancer. Lohan has three younger siblings: Michael Jr., Ali, and Cody.</p><p>Lohan was homeschooled from the age of 11 onward. Her parents, Dina and Michael Lohan, divorced in 2007.</p><h2><span id=Lindsay_Lohans_Career_Highlights>Lindsay Lohan’s Career Highlights</span></h2><p>Lindsay Lohan began her career as a child model, signing with Ford Models at the age of three. She appeared in numerous TV commercials and landed her first television role in 1996 on “Another World.”</p><p>Director Nancy Meyers cast Lohan in the 1998 remake of “The Parent Trap,” which earned her a Young Artist Award. She signed a three-movie deal with Disney and went on to star in “Life Size” and “Get a Clue.”</p><p>Lohan’s breakout role came in 2003’s “Freaky Friday” opposite Jamie Lee Curtis, for which she won the 2004 MTV Movie Award for Breakthrough Performance. She starred in “Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen” and “Mean Girls,” winning four Teen Choice Awards for the latter. Lohan also appeared in “Herbie: Fully Loaded,” “Just My Luck,” and “A Prairie Home Companion.”</p><p>Aside from her acting career, Lohan has also modeled for various fashion brands and released her own line of leggings and self-tanning spray.</p><h2><span id=Lohans_Music_Career>Lohan’s Music Career</span></h2><p>Lohan pursued a music career while also acting, contributing tracks to her movies “Freaky Friday” and “Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen.” Her debut album, “Speak,” was released in December 2004 and reached number four on the music charts.

In 2013, she earned $2 million for interviews with Oprah Winfrey, but a large portion went towards taxes, rehab fees, and debts.</p><h2><span id=Lindsay_Lohans_Net_Worth_Totaling_27556480>Lindsay Lohan’s Net Worth: Totaling $27,556,480</span></h2><p>Lindsay Lohan, the American actress, singer, and entrepreneur, has a net worth of $27,556,480.

However, she has also managed to make a comeback, appearing in films like “The Canyons” and the TV series “Sick Note.”</p><p>Today, Lohan’s net worth is primarily attributed to her acting career, music sales, and various endorsement deals.
