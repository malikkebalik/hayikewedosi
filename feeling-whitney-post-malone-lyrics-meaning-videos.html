He starts by expressing that he's been searching for something, which could be interpreted as a way out of his current situation or a way to ease his pain. He then admits that he's looking for someone who can put up with his "bullshit," showing that he's aware of his flaws but still hopes to find someone who will accept him as he is. He can't leave his bedroom, so he continues to pour himself drinks, indicating that his drinking is a coping mechanism.</p><br><p>Post later refers to his past successes in terms of material possessions, such as cars and clothes, but acknowledges that he was actually losing. He was "feeling Whitney" as he and his friends drank in Houston, possibly referencing the late singer Whitney Houston as a symbol of how intoxication can be used as an escape. Post's friend told him to wake up, but he preferred to stay asleep and ignore his problems.</p><br><p>In the second verse, Post expresses his reliance on drugs and how the people he relied on as sources for those drugs have disappeared. It's common for drug dealers to leave town when the heat is on, but for Post, it means he has no one to depend on when he's sober. He describes a night where he had nothing to do, drank 80 beers, and then sang along to Dwight Yoakam music while smoking cigarettes. He once again drank more, showing that his drinking and drug use are perpetual cycles.</p><br><p>The chorus repeats the message of finding peace in one's own way and avoiding showing emotion. Post seems to be telling himself that he doesn't need anyone else's help or support, but that he can handle things on his own. He ends the song with repeating the mysterious "oohs" from the beginning, possibly indicating his continued search for something to ease his pain.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>I've been looking for some- Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh</u><br>The singer has been searching for something, and the 'oohs' represent the frustration and desperation he feels.</p><br><p><u>And I've been looking for someone to put up with my bullshit</u><br>The singer wants to find someone who is willing to tolerate his flaws and emotional baggage.</p><br><p><u>I can't even leave my bedroom so I keep pouring And I ain't seen a light of day since, well, that's not important It's been long And I was feeling Whitney, me and my homies sip Houston</u><br>The singer is struggling with depression and isolation, using alcohol as a coping mechanism. He misses the good times he had with his friends in Houston and associates Whitney Houston's music with those memories.</p><br><p><u>Cars and clothes, thought I was winning You knew I was losing You told me to wake up but my clock always stays on snooze And I'm done</u><br>The singer was once focused on material possessions and was blind to the fact that they didn't bring him true happiness. Someone close to him tried to tell him to change, but he was resistant and has now given up on trying to improve.</p><br><p><u>To each their own and find peace in knowing Ain't always broken, but here's to hoping Show no emotion, against your coding Just act as hard as you can You don't need a friend Boy, you're the man</u><br>The song's chorus suggests that each person should find their own way of coping with life's difficulties. It encourages the listener to suppress their emotions and always act tough, because true strength comes from within rather than relying on others for support.</p><br><p><u>And I've been looking for someone that I can buy my drugs from It seems like every plug ran east to Utah, became Mormons Drought comes around, feels like I have no one to depend on Sober, ugh I had 80 beers on Tuesday night, I had nothing to do then I put on a little Dwight and sang a happy tune And lit a cigarette, stepped out the door, had an appearance Drank more</u><br>The singer is struggling with addiction and finding it difficult to source drugs. He feels alone and vulnerable when he is sober, but uses music and alcohol to give himself temporary relief.</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Lyrics © Universal Music Publishing Group, Peermusic Publishing<br>Written by: Andrew Wotman, Austin Richard Post</span></p><p>Lyrics Licensed & Provided by <a class=ext-link href=# rel=nofollow>LyricFind</a></p>To comment on or correct specific content, <span>highlight it</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn6O2pLTIrapnm5%2BifLe1w56maIifqMGgmcClpqedX3uyprjIp56Yj5iewa%2Bx2A%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ffeeling-whitney-post-malone-lyrics-meaning-videos.html&text=Feeling%20Whitney%20%7c%20Post%20Malone%20Lyrics%2c%20Meaning%20%26amp%3b%20Videos&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffeeling-whitney-post-malone-lyrics-meaning-videos.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffeeling-whitney-post-malone-lyrics-meaning-videos.html&title=Feeling%20Whitney%20%7c%20Post%20Malone%20Lyrics%2c%20Meaning%20%26amp%3b%20Videos" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ffeeling-whitney-post-malone-lyrics-meaning-videos.html&title=Feeling%20Whitney%20%7c%20Post%20Malone%20Lyrics%2c%20Meaning%20%26amp%3b%20Videos" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ffeeling-whitney-post-malone-lyrics-meaning-videos.html&title=Feeling%20Whitney%20%7c%20Post%20Malone%20Lyrics%2c%20Meaning%20%26amp%3b%20Videos" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffeeling-whitney-post-malone-lyrics-meaning-videos.html&description=Feeling%20Whitney%20%7c%20Post%20Malone%20Lyrics%2c%20Meaning%20%26amp%3b%20Videos" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./isaac-hilleger-dating-girlfriend-breakup-net-worth-facts-wiki-bio.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Isaac Hilleger Dating, Girlfriend, Breakup, Net Worth, Facts, Wiki-Bio">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./elena-franklin.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Elena Franklin">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
