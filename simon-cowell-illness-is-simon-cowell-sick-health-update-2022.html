He has judged the British talent shows Pop Idol (2001–2003), The X Factor UK (2004–2010, 2014–2018), and Britain’s Got Talent (2007–present), as well as the American talent competitions American Idol (2002–2010), The X Factor US (2011–2013), and America’s Got Talent (2016–present). Cowell is the sole owner and creator of Syco, a British entertainment corporation.</p><p>Simon Cowell, a veteran producer, and American Idol judge, was hospitalized last week after a bike accident, according to Variety.</p><p>According to various stories that surfaced Tuesday night, the “America’s Got Talent” judge was involved in an accident near his London home last Thursday, was hospitalized, and then released.</p><p>Let’s Explore American Idol and judge illnesses and problems.</p><h2><strong>Simon Cowell’s Illness: Is Simon Cowell Sick?</strong></h2><p>Despite the reality that <a href=#><strong>Simon Cowell</strong></a> had previously struggled with a variety of illnesses and problems, some suspect that he’d have suffered a stroke. He had a back injury, and his second fall left him with shattered bones in his legs and arms.</p><p>“Simon was riding his electric bike when it slipped on a damp place,” a source close to Cowell told the British tabloid The Mirror. “He flew over the handlebars and into the center of the street, lucky to be alive because he wasn’t wearing a helmet.”</p><p>His face was covered in blood, but he was able to receive some treatment from passers-by. He was rushed to the hospital, where X-rays revealed that he had broken his arm. He has a yellow cast on his arm and is recovering, but he will need to rest.”</p><p>“Simon shattered his arm and is doing okay today,” a source close to the situation told People.</p><p>After breaking his back in a bike accident in 2020, Cowell had to take a leave of absence from television to recover from surgery and intensive rehab. After 17 years, his beloved talent show “The X Factor” was terminated in 2021.</p><p>He was supposed to be a judge on “Walk the Line,” a music talent competition, but he was replaced by singer Gary Barlow. He remained on the show, concentrating on his responsibilities as show creator and executive producer.</p><p>Cowell also canceled his involvement as a judge on “The X Factor Israel” in 2021.</p><p>Cowell just wrapped filming for the new season of “Britain’s Got Talent,” which will premiere in April.</p><h3><strong>Simon Cowell’s Personal Life</strong></h3><p>Cowell married Idol makeup artist Mezhgan Hussainy in 2010 after dating entertainment reporter Terri Seymour. The following year, however, the couple called off their engagement, with Cowell stating, “We came to the conclusion that I’m a hopeless boyfriend.” He afterward began dating actress and model Carmen Electra.</p><p>By 2013, the famous TV personality was secretly dating Lauren Silverman, a New York City socialite who was then married to a friend of Cowell’s. Silverman’s husband sought a divorce after their romance resulted in a pregnancy. Cowell became a father on February 14, 2014, when his son Eric was born.</p><p>Despite previously claiming that he had no desire for children, Cowell had changed his mind by the time his own son was born. He told the media, “Eric is simply wonderful and so humorous.” “Becoming a father is the most wonderful thing that has ever occurred to me.”</p><p>Cowell announced in 2019 that he has switched to a vegan diet in order to live a healthier lifestyle.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfnrmtusSsqmaZnpl6qbHApauhZ6OeurC6jJymsJ2coXqquMunnKyrX2qAdH6O</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsimon-cowell-illness-is-simon-cowell-sick-health-update-2022.html&text=Simon%20Cowell%20Illness%3a%20Is%20Simon%20Cowell%20Sick%3f%20Health%20Update%202022&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsimon-cowell-illness-is-simon-cowell-sick-health-update-2022.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsimon-cowell-illness-is-simon-cowell-sick-health-update-2022.html&title=Simon%20Cowell%20Illness%3a%20Is%20Simon%20Cowell%20Sick%3f%20Health%20Update%202022" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsimon-cowell-illness-is-simon-cowell-sick-health-update-2022.html&title=Simon%20Cowell%20Illness%3a%20Is%20Simon%20Cowell%20Sick%3f%20Health%20Update%202022" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsimon-cowell-illness-is-simon-cowell-sick-health-update-2022.html&title=Simon%20Cowell%20Illness%3a%20Is%20Simon%20Cowell%20Sick%3f%20Health%20Update%202022" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsimon-cowell-illness-is-simon-cowell-sick-health-update-2022.html&description=Simon%20Cowell%20Illness%3a%20Is%20Simon%20Cowell%20Sick%3f%20Health%20Update%202022" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./this-is-us-actor-justin-hartley-is-dating-a-new-partner-sofia-pernas-following-two-divorce.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="This Is Us Actor, Justin Hartley Is Dating a New Partner, Sofia Pernas Following Two Divorce">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ryan-deffet-died-know-his-cause-of-death.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ryan Deffet Died: Know His Cause of Death?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
