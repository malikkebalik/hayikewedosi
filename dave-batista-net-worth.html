Dave did not have perfect childhood, as his parents divorced and his family did not have a lot of money. While being only 13 years old, Batista had to steal cars in order to gain some money. When he became older, he decided to live by his own and started to work as a bouncer for the living. Unfortunately, Dave was involved in the fight and was even sentenced for it. Before starting his career as a bodybuilder, Batista had to work as a lifeguard as well.</p><p>Dave was very determined and wanted to start his career as a professional wrestler. Batista’s debut was in Ohio Valley Wrestling. His hard work was worth it, as Dave was very successful at wrestling and even had won OVW Heavyweight Championship. When Dave’s skills were noticed by others he became a part of World Wrestling Entertainment. This added a lot to Batista’s net worth. Dave’s career in WWE was as well very successful. With other wrestlers such as Ric Flair, <a href=#>Randy Orton</a> and <a href=#>Triple H</a> he formed stable title Evolution. Unfortunately, Batista experienced an injury and had to make a pause. After recovering from his injury, Dave was able to show that he is still a very strong opponent for other wrestlers. Batista’s popularity grew with each fight that he had. This of course affected Dave Batista’s net worth as well. Now Batista is on hiatus as a wrestler, but he has many other activities to keep him busy.</p><p>As it was mentioned before, Dave is not only known as a professional wrestler but he also had appeared in several movies and television shows. Batista appeared on Extreme Makeover: Home Edition, Smallville, Faily Feud and Iron Chef America. Wrong Side of Town, The Man with the Iron Fists, Riddick, The Man with the Iron Fists are only a few movies in which Batista acted. Appearances in movies and television shows, undoubtedly added up to Dave’s net worth. Dave Batista is one of the best wrestlers and one of those people who were able to show that it doesn’t matter if had to live in poverty as a child you are still able to achieve much more in your life. It is not clear if Batista will return to wrestling but he is still very popular and appears in many different projects.
