Featherman described the group surrounding her "like a swarm of bees" and alleged that their "fake fingernails" ended up in her hair during the altercation.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>:</p><h2 class=split>'Poolside Karen' claims she was 'assaulted'</h2><p>During the recent interview, Featherman recounted the incident, stating, "They swarmed over like a swarm of bees, it was very fast." She also claimed that the group took her phone while she was trying to record the incident.</p><p>Featherman said that she found fake fingernails that had "ripped off" in her hair when the group, whom she referred to as "pool hoppers," had a physical altercation with her.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>:</p><p>The incident unfolded at an upscale apartment complex in Lakewood, , where the pool is gated and exclusively accessible to residents.</p><p>In the viral video capturing Featherman's actions, she can be heard derogatorily referring to the Hispanic family at the pool as "trash" and "low-class slime."</p><p><b>Also Read</b>:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/b936f0d0-4ce4-4eba-a266-7f53ddb25dd7.png><p>Featherman shared a new video from her phone with the outlet, claiming that the clips depict the attack she experienced. In this video, her legs are visible, and she appears to be pushed back while lying on a pool chair as a large group surrounds her.</p><p>"I got pushed first by a man, and then the women jumped on me," she said. "That is assault, that is assault," a voice in the recording can be heard saying.&nbsp;</p><p>According to reports, Featherman and her boyfriend approached a group of people she didn't recognize entering the pool area.</p><p>"We noticed a party gathering on the other side of the pool and it was getting bigger and bigger and bigger," Featherman said, sharing that the complex had a problem with non-residents entering and staying "all day".</p><p>Featherman explained to Inside Edition that she and her boyfriend requested to see the group's key fobs, and when they refused, she instructed her boyfriend to "call security."</p><p>It was after this moment that she returned to her lounge chair, where the alleged attack occurred as the partygoers rushed over.</p><p>"I was literally curled up in a ball, trying to do as much as I could to get them from getting in close to me," Featherman said.&nbsp;</p><p>Featherman acknowledged that during the altercation, she may have "pulled a girl's hair" and "poked some eyes," but she insisted that these actions were taken in self-defense because she had "four women on top of her".</p><p>Blair Featherman contacted the police and requested immediate assistance for an ongoing assault. While waiting for the police to arrive, she mentioned that she went to retrieve her phone, which was when the now widely-known confrontation occurred.</p><p>"I'm running around looking for my phone," Featherman said, adding, "911 is being called, I see this girl recording me, so I grabbed it. But then I gave it back 5 minutes later."</p><h2 class=split>'Poolside Karen' apologizes for her racist comments</h2><p>Although Blair Featherman referred to the Hispanic family at the center of the incident as "low-class slime" and "trash," she insisted that she was not racist. She expressed a desire to apologize.</p><p>"I completely apologize for saying what I did about the pool party," she said.&nbsp;</p><p>"I have been trying to stay silent and not comment about this, but there are things the video doesn't show," Featherman told . "I'm not a racist. It was deceptively edited and put together to tell a narrative that isn't true," she said in July.&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm not usually racist at all, but I'll tell you what, they come in, and they come in for their party, they're trashy, they're nasty, and they don't belong here. I pay for this," she was heard saying.</p><h2 class=split>Netizens brand 'Poolside Karen' a 'racist'</h2><p>People are sharing their reactions to Poolside Karen's new interview on social media.&nbsp;</p><p>One user on X, formerly Twitter, wrote, "Well, I think that sentiment does need some good counseling. She may have done things to defend herself, but her behavior in my opinion is absolutely unacceptable."</p><p>"Her exact words on the show was I'm not usually racist. Not usually?" questioned another, while a third said, "I'm not usually racist, means you are racist."</p><p>Another wrote, "She accused being assaulted while assaulting someone. Typical Karen. And shame on Inside Edition of only reporting one side of the story."</p><p>However, one person chose to defend her. They wrote, "I watched so many times- how was this racist?? All I see is she may be right with the 'trashy' part.. I mean who goes over and attacks someone..??"</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Well, I think that sentiment does need some good counseling.
