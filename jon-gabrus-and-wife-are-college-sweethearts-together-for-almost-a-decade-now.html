The lovebirds, who have been together for almost eighteen years now,&nbsp;met during their&nbsp;junior year&nbsp;of college in 2002 at Marist College in New York.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Jon Gabrus with his wife, Tiffany Gabrus. </strong>(Photo: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>In February 2020, the stand-up comedian <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">took to Instagram</a> to&nbsp;share a photo of his beautiful spouse on the occasion of their seventeenth anniversary of being a&nbsp;couple.</p><p>Jon remarked that he had loved every moment of their life since they got together. He expressed he was looking forward to a hundred more years together. His&nbsp;caption, to be precise, read: <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>I have loved every minute of the 8.93 million minutes since I asked, ‘would you like to be my girlfriend?’ Here’s to a hundred more years of telling me every single detail from your day. Love you, Rat Queen (and Cheech).</p><p>Not only that single photo, but a scroll through Jon's Instagram will clarify that he is head over heels in love with his wife, Tiffany.</p><p>The reality TV star has shared&nbsp;several heartwarming pictures with his better half, and we're all for it.</p><p>One of those is&nbsp;a throwback portrait of their college days that he shared on 2017&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Valentine's Day</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The duo looked very young and happy in the picture, smiling&nbsp;ears to ears. He wrote, "Happy&nbsp;#ValentinesDay&nbsp;to my wife. This is 14 years ago. Junior year at Marist (tho the wall should tell you it's college)..."</p><h2>Jon Gabrus and Tiffany Married in 2011</h2><p>After dating for almost nine years, the 39-year-old actor popped the question to his college sweetheart&nbsp;and then walked <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">down the aisle</a> on October 15, 2011.</p><p>Every year on their anniversary, Jon posts pictures of his spouse to show his love and appreciation and celebrate their togetherness with his fans and followers.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>On their ninth wedding anniversary, he posted a family portrait including himself, Tiffany, and their dog Arthur. Under the photo, he wrote:</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>We got married 9 years ago today. We dated for almost 9 years before getting married... Love you, boogs. (And I guess maybe I secretly like posing for all these ‘dumb’ family photos you make me take).</p><p>He did a similar thing on their 10th anniversary. He posted a picture with her and dedicated a message to her "Truly no one else could handle being locked in an apt with me for almost two years (and I THINK vice versa)," he humorously penned.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Then the Wild 'N Out star added he was proud of his wife besides being "disgustingly attracted to you." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><h2>Tiffany Gabrus Is a Marketing Guru</h2><p>While the <a href=# rel=follow>comedian</a>&nbsp;is all about social media PDA, his better half likes to keep her personal life to herself and has private social media accounts. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>That being said, the Marist College graduate is as multi-talented&nbsp;as her husband.

According to her LinkedIn, she has gained quite the marketing experience as she has been working for over fifteen years.</p><p>The marketing proficient has worked as the Vice President and Executive Director of a media company named&nbsp;Starz.
